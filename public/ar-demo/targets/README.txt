Place your MindAR compiled targets file here as `targets.mind` and the original image as `pitcher.png` (or update index.html link).

How to generate:
1) Open the MindAR Target Images Compiler: https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile
2) Upload your image (e.g., the Pitcher plant photo).
   - Tips: Use a sharp, high-contrast image. Avoid heavy blur/glare; texture helps.
3) Adjust the region if needed, then click Export to download `targets.mind`.
4) Save the original image here as `pitcher.png` for reference.
5) In your browser, open `/ar-demo/?local=1` to use the local targets.

Switching back to sample target:
- Open `/ar-demo/` or `/ar-demo/?` (no `local=1`).
